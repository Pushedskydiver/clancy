# Configuration

Set during `/clancy:init` advanced setup, or by editing `.clancy/.env` directly. Use `/clancy:settings` → "Save as defaults" to save non-credential settings to `~/.clancy/defaults.json` — new projects created with `/clancy:init` will inherit them automatically.

## Figma MCP

```
FIGMA_API_KEY=your-key
```

When a ticket description contains a Figma URL, Clancy fetches design specs automatically:

1. Figma MCP: `get_metadata` → `get_design_context` → `get_screenshot` (3 calls)
2. Figma REST API image export (fallback)
3. Ticket image attachment (fallback)

## Playwright visual checks

```
PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true
PLAYWRIGHT_DEV_COMMAND="yarn dev"
PLAYWRIGHT_DEV_PORT=5173
PLAYWRIGHT_STORYBOOK_COMMAND="yarn storybook"  # if applicable
PLAYWRIGHT_STORYBOOK_PORT=6006                 # if applicable
PLAYWRIGHT_STARTUP_WAIT=15
```

After implementing a UI ticket, Clancy starts the dev server or Storybook, screenshots, assesses visually, checks the console, and fixes anything wrong before committing.

## Status transitions

```
CLANCY_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS="In Progress"
CLANCY_STATUS_DONE="Done"
```

Clancy automatically moves tickets through your board when it picks up and completes them. Set these to the exact column name shown in your Jira or Linear board. Best-effort — a failed transition never stops the run. Configurable via `/clancy:settings`.

## Notifications

```
CLANCY_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
```

Posts to Slack or Teams when a ticket completes or Clancy hits an error. URL is auto-detected.
