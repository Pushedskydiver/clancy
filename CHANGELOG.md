## [0.8.24] — 2026-03-23

### ♻️ Refactors

- **`fetchAndParse<T>()` shared utility** — generic fetch → JSON → Zod validation helper in `src/scripts/shared/http/fetch-and-parse.ts`. Eliminates the repeated try/fetch/check-ok/parse-json/validate-zod boilerplate. Returns parsed data or `undefined` on any failure (network, HTTP status, invalid JSON, schema mismatch). All failures logged with a configurable label. 8 new unit tests.
- **GitHub board: use `fetchAndParse`** — converted `fetchIssues()` to use the shared utility. Removed ~25 lines of boilerplate.
- **Jira board: use `fetchAndParse`** — converted `fetchTickets()` and `lookupTransitionId()` to use the shared utility. Removed ~45 lines of boilerplate.
- **`fetchAndParse` custom fetcher** — optional `fetcher` param for boards that need custom fetch functions (e.g., Notion's `retryFetch` for rate limits). 3 new unit tests.
- **Linear board: use `fetchAndParse`** — converted `fetchIssues()`, `fetchBlockerStatus()`, `lookupWorkflowStateId()`, `executeStateTransition()`, `fetchChildrenByDescription()`. Added `linearInit()` helper to build GraphQL requests. Removed ~35 lines of boilerplate.
- **Shortcut board: use `fetchAndParse`** — converted `fetchWorkflows()`, `fetchLabels()`, `createLabel()`, `fetchStory()`, `getStoryLabelIds()`. Removed ~75 lines of boilerplate.
- **Notion board: use `fetchAndParse`** — converted `queryDatabase()` and `fetchPage()` using the custom `fetcher` param with `retryFetch`. Removed ~30 lines of boilerplate.
- **Azure DevOps board: use `fetchAndParse`** — converted `runWiql()`, `fetchWorkItem()`, `fetchChildrenByLinks()`. Removed ~40 lines of boilerplate.
- **`DeliveryParams` options object** — replaced 9 positional parameters on `deliverViaPullRequest()` with a single `DeliveryParams` type. Named properties make call sites self-documenting.
- **`computeDeliveryOutcome()` pure function** — extracted PR outcome logic from the 103-line if/else chain in `deliverViaPullRequest()` into a testable pure function. Returns a `DeliveryOutcome` discriminated union (`created`, `exists`, `failed`, `not_attempted`, `local`, `unsupported`). Orchestrator switches on outcome type for logging and progress. 8 new unit tests.
- **Delivery orchestrator simplification** — extracted `readVerificationWarning()`, `buildEpicContext()`, `logOutcome()`, and `progressForOutcome()` helpers. Replaced 6 duplicated `appendProgress` calls in the switch with a single call using `progressForOutcome()`. Applied `computeDeliveryOutcome` to `deliverEpicToBase`. Removed unnecessary `else` in `ensureEpicBranch`. 6 new unit tests.
- **Board label CRUD consolidation** — shared `modifyLabelList<T>()` (generic read-modify-write with idempotence) and `safeLabel()` (try-catch + warn wrapper) in `src/scripts/board/label-helpers/`. Applied to Jira, Shortcut, Notion, Azure DevOps. Works with both string labels and numeric IDs. 13 new unit tests.
- **Rework platform handler map** — replaced 3 switch statements in `rework.ts` with `PlatformReworkHandlers` type and `resolvePlatformHandlers()` factory in `rework-handlers.ts`. Single switch creates a handler object; main functions call uniform methods (`checkReviewState`, `fetchComments`, `postComment`, `resolveThreads`, `reRequestReview`). Platform-specific no-ops for GitLab-only and GitHub-only actions.
- **Remote parsing deduplication** — extracted `buildRemoteInfo()` in `remote.ts` to consolidate the platform-specific path extraction that was duplicated between `parseRemote()` and `overrideRemotePlatform()`. Single switch for all path parsing; `overrideRemotePlatform` reduced to 5 lines.

## [0.8.23] — 2026-03-23

### 📝 Docs

- **TESTING.md rewrite (QA-004b)** — complete rewrite documenting the 3-layer QA architecture (unit, integration, E2E). Quick reference with all npm test scripts. Layer 1: co-located unit tests with file tree and patterns for adding board/utility tests. Layer 2: MSW + Claude simulator integration tests with fixture freshness feedback cycle. Layer 3: real-API E2E tests with credential table, CI schedule, no-retry policy, and orphan GC. Contributor requirements section.

---

## [0.8.22] — 2026-03-22

### 📦 Chores

- **GitHub Actions E2E workflow (QA-003e)** — `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` with weekly schedule (Monday 6am UTC), manual dispatch with per-board selection, orphan GC job before test matrix, per-board matrix (6 boards, `fail-fast: false`, 30min timeout), live schema validation job, and concurrency group to prevent overlapping runs. All board credentials mapped from GitHub Actions secrets. GitHub uses `QA_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `QA_GITHUB_REPO` to avoid collision with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

---

## [0.8.21] — 2026-03-22

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Child PR bodies now include epic context** — when a child ticket targets an epic/milestone branch, the PR body shows the parent epic key, how many siblings have already been delivered, and a note that this targets an intermediate branch. Gives reviewers and downstream tooling (e.g., Ralph-o-bot) full context on where the PR sits in the epic flow. Fixes #75 (issue 1).
- **GitHub epic PR: add build label to parent issue** — after creating the final epic PR (`milestone/N` → `main`), Clancy now adds the `clancy:build` label (or `CLANCY_LABEL` fallback) to the parent GitHub issue. This enables downstream tooling that drives merge queues by label (e.g., Ralph-o-bot) to discover and merge the epic PR. Non-GitHub boards continue to use `transitionTicket` as before. Fixes #75 (issue 2).

### ✅ Tests

- **Fixture feedback loop (QA-003d)** — two validation scripts that detect drift between MSW fixtures, Zod schemas, and real API responses. **Offline fixture validation** (`npm run test:fixtures:validate`) reads each happy-path fixture in `test/integration/mocks/fixtures/` and validates it against the corresponding Zod schema — no credentials needed, safe for CI. Covers all 6 boards including Azure DevOps composite (WIQL + batch). **Live schema validation** (`npm run test:fixtures:live`) hits each board's auth/health endpoint with real credentials and validates the response shape — catches API drift faster than full E2E (no ticket creation, no Git ops). Skips boards without credentials. Added `test/e2e/captured-responses/` directory (gitignored) for optional raw response capture. 2 new npm scripts.
- 11 new unit tests: 7 for epic context in PR body (banner content, singular/plural, first-child, non-epic target, Jira boards) + 4 for GitHub label in `deliverEpicToBase` (label addition, fallback, non-GitHub transition, error resilience). 1246 unit + 238 integration + 6 E2E = 1490 total.

---

## [0.8.20] — 2026-03-22

### ✅ Tests

- **E2E tests for Notion and Azure DevOps (QA-003c)** — ticket factory, cleanup, and orphan GC implementations for the final 2 boards, completing Layer 2 E2E coverage across all 6 supported boards. Notion: `POST /v1/pages` creation, archive cleanup, paginated database query GC. Azure DevOps: `POST /_apis/wit/workitems/$Task` with JSON Patch, hard-delete cleanup (fallback to close), WIQL-based orphan GC. Shared `azdo-auth.ts` helper for consistent auth across E2E files. E2E scaffold fix: non-GitHub boards must not include `GITHUB_REPO` (causes `detectBoard` to detect GitHub Issues instead). 2 new E2E tests (6 total). 1235 unit + 238 integration + 6 E2E = 1479 total tests.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Linear API compatibility (production)** — Linear's GraphQL schema now requires `ID!` (not `String!`) for the `$teamId` variable in `viewer.assignedIssues` filter, and removed `priority` from the `PaginationOrderBy` enum. Both changes caused the production `fetchTickets` query to silently return HTTP 400, resulting in "No tickets found". Fixed `$teamId` type and changed `orderBy: priority` to `orderBy: createdAt`.
- **Shortcut API compatibility (production)** — Shortcut removed `workflow_state_ids` from `/stories/search` (now `workflow_state_id` singular). Response shape changed from `{ data: [...] }` to bare array. `/member-info` returns 404 for some API token types — ping now falls back to `/workflows` and accepts array responses.
- **Notion status filter (production)** — `or(status, select)` filter now returns 400. Use single `status` type. Added `CLANCY_NOTION_TODO` env var for configurable status value name (default `"To-do"`).
- **detectBoard priority** — non-GitHub board scaffolds must not include `GITHUB_REPO` — `detectBoard` checks `GITHUB_TOKEN + GITHUB_REPO` before other boards, causing misdetection as GitHub Issues.
- **Jira E2E label** — `clancy:build` contains a colon which fails Jira's `isSafeJqlValue` validation. Jira E2E uses `clancy-build`.

---

## [0.8.19] — 2026-03-22

### ✅ Tests

- **E2E tests for Jira, Linear, Shortcut (QA-003b)** — ticket factory, cleanup, and orphan GC implementations for 3 new boards. Jira: `POST /rest/api/3/issue` creation, transition-to-Done cleanup, JQL-based orphan GC. Linear: `issueCreate` GraphQL mutation, `issueDelete` cleanup, title-based orphan GC (personal API keys — no Bearer prefix). Shortcut: `POST /api/v3/stories` creation with workflow state resolution, `DELETE` cleanup, search-based orphan GC. Each E2E test creates a real ticket → runs orchestrator with Claude simulator → verifies PR created on GitHub sandbox repo → cleans up. All non-GitHub boards use GitHub as git host for PR creation. 3 new E2E tests (4 total).

### ♻️ Refactors

- **Centralise progress status constants** — extracted `DELIVERED_STATUSES`, `COMPLETED_STATUSES`, and `FAILED_STATUSES` from inline `Set` definitions in `resume.ts` and `report.ts` into shared constants in `src/types/remote.ts`. Addresses Copilot review feedback on PR #72 about status set drift. `SessionTicket.status` typed as `ProgressStatus` (was `string`).

---

## [0.8.18] — 2026-03-22

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Resume module: detect already-delivered work from stale lock** — when a session crashes after pushing branch + creating PR but before lock deletion, the AFK runner no longer picks up the same ticket and enters a PUSH_FAILED loop. `detectResume` now checks `progress.txt` for delivery statuses (PR_CREATED, PUSHED, REWORK, RESUMED) when the branch exists but has no local work to recover. `lockCheck` skips already-delivered tickets and continues to fresh ticket fetch. 8 new unit tests (1235 total).

---

## [0.8.17] — 2026-03-22

### 🐛 Fixes

- **GitHub single-child epic flow (2 bugs)** — (1) `computeTargetBranch` now detects `#N` issue refs and uses `epic/{number}` prefix instead of `milestone/{slug}`. Previously `Parent: #44` produced `milestone/44`, causing PRs to target a non-existent branch instead of `main`. Milestone titles (e.g. "Sprint 3") still produce `milestone/sprint-3`. (2) `fetchChildrenStatus` now falls back to `{ total: 1, incomplete: 1 }` when GitHub Search API returns 0 results but a `currentTicketKey` is provided — guards against the ~3-5s indexing delay when a child ticket is created and the implementer runs immediately. Fixes #70. 4 new unit tests (1227 total).

---

## [0.8.16] — 2026-03-22

### ✅ Tests

- **E2E test infrastructure + GitHub board E2E test (QA-003a)** — Layer 2 E2E testing against real APIs. Vitest E2E config (60s timeout, no retry, reuses integration global-setup for shared node_modules). Credential loading from `.env.e2e` (local) or `process.env` (CI) with per-board `hasCredentials()` gating. Ticket factory creates real issues on GitHub Issues with `[QA]` prefix and unique run ID for isolation. Cleanup helpers close tickets, close PRs, and delete remote branches. Orphan GC script (`npm run test:e2e:gc`) queries for stale `[QA]` tickets/PRs/branches older than 24 hours. GIT_ASKPASS helper for secure git push authentication without embedding tokens in URLs. GitHub E2E test: creates real issue → runs orchestrator with Claude simulator → verifies feature branch pushed to sandbox repo → verifies PR created via GitHub API → verifies progress.txt entry → cleans up. 1 new E2E test.

---

## [0.8.15] — 2026-03-22

### ✅ Tests

- **Context monitor + post-compact hook integration tests (QA-002b-5)** — completes Layer 1 hook coverage. Context monitor: threshold boundary tests (40% no warning, 35% WARNING, 25% CRITICAL), debounce suppression across 5 calls, severity escalation bypasses debounce (WARNING→CRITICAL). Time guard: 80% WARNING, 100%+ CRITICAL, below-threshold silence, time escalation bypass. PostCompact: full ticket context re-injection (hookEventName, key, title, branch, target, parent, description), missing lock file silence, missing required fields silence, corrupt lock file fail-open, empty parentKey omission, 2000-char description truncation. 1223 unit tests (unchanged) + 238 integration tests (17 new). **Layer 1 integration testing complete.**

---

## [0.8.14] — 2026-03-22

### ✅ Tests

- **Credential guard + branch guard hook integration tests (QA-002b-4)** — expanded hook scenario coverage via argv JSON contract: all 14 credential pattern categories (generic key/secret/token/password, AWS access+secret, GitHub PAT classic+fine-grained+OAuth, Slack xoxb+xoxp, Stripe live+test, RSA/EC/DSA/OPENSSH private keys, Atlassian, Linear, MongoDB/PostgreSQL/MySQL/Redis connection strings), all 5 allowed paths, edge cases (comments, test files, short strings, fail-open), Edit+MultiEdit tool support. Branch guard: force push, protected branches (main/master/develop + custom CLANCY_BASE_BRANCH), destructive ops (reset --hard, clean -fd, checkout --, restore ., branch -D), allowed ops, disabled guard, fail-open. 1223 unit tests (unchanged) + 221 integration tests (69 new).

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Branch guard: flag-before-remote bypass** — `git push -u origin main` and `git push --set-upstream origin main` were not blocked because the regex consumed the flag as the remote token. Updated pattern to skip flags (`-\S+`) before matching remote and branch.

---

## [0.8.13] — 2026-03-22

### ✅ Tests

- **Installer sub-module integration tests (QA-002b-3)** — real filesystem tests for installer sub-modules: file-ops (copyDir recursive copy, symlink rejection, parent auto-creation, overwrite), manifest (buildManifest SHA-256 hashes, detectModifiedFiles change detection, backupModifiedFiles with metadata, end-to-end build→modify→detect→backup), hook-installer (file copying, CommonJS package.json, settings.json merge, existing config preservation, idempotent re-install, verification gate agent hook, statusLine preservation), role filtering (null=all, empty=core-only, selective optional roles, core always included).

### 🐛 Fixes

- **GitHub Issues: parse `Epic: #N` from description for parent detection** — when a child issue has no milestone but contains `Epic: #N` (or `Parent: #N`) in its description, the parent relationship is now detected. Previously `parentInfo` was always `ticket.milestone ?? 'none'`, so strategist-created child issues under a parent issue (not a milestone) had no parent, breaking single-child epic skip and `Closes` auto-close in PR bodies.

1223 unit tests (3 new) + 152 integration tests (34 new).

---

## [0.8.12] — 2026-03-22

### ✅ Tests

- **Pipeline label transition integration tests (QA-002b-2)** — cross-role label lifecycle tests: Brief → Plan → Build full pipeline with add-before-remove ordering, plan-label guard (dual-label race condition prevention with console spy verification), label crash safety (500 on removeLabel), CLANCY_LABEL backward compatibility fallback. 1220 unit tests (unchanged) + 118 integration tests (6 new).

---

## [0.8.11] — 2026-03-22

### 🐛 Fixes

- **GitHub rework detection no longer filters out PR owner's comments** — replaced `excludeAuthor` (author-based filtering) with `[clancy]` content-based filtering. Clancy's automated post-rework comments are still excluded, but the user's own `Rework:` comments now pass through even when using the same GitHub token. Fixes infinite loop reported by Jamie.

### ✅ Tests

- 1220 unit tests (3 new: `[clancy]` prefix filtering, user Rework: passthrough, mixed comment filtering) + 112 integration tests

---

## [0.8.10] — 2026-03-22

### ♻️ Refactors

- **Split integration tests into per-board files** — `implementer.test.ts` (796 lines) and `board-api.test.ts` (1135 lines) replaced by 6 per-board files under `flows/board/` with shared helpers. Each board file contains both implementer lifecycle and write operation tests. 112 integration tests unchanged.

---

## [0.8.9] — 2026-03-22

### ✨ Features

- **Board write operation integration tests (QA-002b-1)** — MSW-backed tests for all 4 Board type write methods (ensureLabel, addLabel, removeLabel, transitionTicket) across all 6 boards (GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, Shortcut, Notion, Azure DevOps). Request spy capture pattern validates correct API calls per board's distinct protocol (REST, GraphQL, JSON Patch). Includes edge cases: cache persistence (Linear), invalid key guards (Jira, GitHub), workflow state not found (Shortcut), 422 dedup handling (GitHub).

### ✅ Tests

- 1217 unit tests (unchanged) + 112 integration tests (41 new board write operation tests)

---

## [0.8.8] — 2026-03-21

### ✨ Features

- **AFK loop integration tests (QA-002a-5)** — in-process runner injection tests for `runAfkLoop`: processes N tickets then exits at MAX_ITERATIONS, exits cleanly on empty queue (stop condition), stops on preflight failure. Added GitHub PR list handler for PR review state checking (rework detection).

### ✅ Tests

- 1217 unit tests (unchanged) + 71 integration tests (3 new AFK loop tests)

---

## [0.8.7] — 2026-03-21

### ✨ Features

- **Advanced implementer integration tests (QA-002a-4)** — blocked ticket skip (4 boards: Jira, Linear, Shortcut, Azure DevOps with native blocker detection), epic branch targeting (PR targets epic branch when ticket has parent), stale lock cleanup (dead PID detection + normal execution continues), and AFK resume detection (unpushed commits recovered from crashed session).

### ✅ Tests

- 1217 unit tests (unchanged) + 68 integration tests (7 new: 4 blocked + 1 epic + 1 stale lock + 1 resume)

---

## [0.8.6] — 2026-03-21

### ✨ Features

- **All 6 boards integration tested (QA-002a-3)** — parameterised implementer lifecycle tests across Jira, GitHub Issues, Linear, Shortcut, Notion, and Azure DevOps. Each board runs happy path, empty queue, auth failure, and dry-run scenarios. MSW handler variants (empty + auth failure) added for all boards.

### ✅ Tests

- 1217 unit tests (unchanged) + 61 integration tests (24 new: 6 boards × 4 scenarios)

---

## [0.8.5] — 2026-03-21

### ✨ Features

- **Implementer early exit integration tests (QA-002a-2)** — empty queue, auth failure, and dry-run scenarios for the once orchestrator. GitHub Issues MSW handler variants (`githubIssuesEmptyHandlers`, `githubIssuesAuthFailureHandlers`).

### ✅ Tests

- 1217 unit tests (unchanged) + 41 integration tests (3 new early exit tests)

---

## [0.8.4] — 2026-03-21

### ✨ Features

- **Implementer happy path integration test (QA-002a-1)** — first end-to-end integration test that runs the full 13-phase once orchestrator pipeline against a temp git repo with MSW-intercepted GitHub Issues API calls. Proves the pattern: preflight mock + board detection + ticket fetch + branch setup + Claude simulator + PR creation + progress logging.

### ✅ Tests

- 1217 unit tests (unchanged) + 38 integration tests (1 new flow test)

---

## [0.8.3] — 2026-03-21

### ✨ Features

- **Integration test infrastructure (QA-001)** — foundation for all subsequent integration test flows:
  - Claude output simulator (`simulateClaudeSuccess`, `simulateClaudeFailure`, `createSequencedClaudeMock`)
  - Temp git repo with real TypeScript project scaffold (shared `node_modules` via symlink for fast setup)
  - MSW server helper with strict unhandled request checking
  - Smoke MSW handlers for all 6 boards (Jira, GitHub, Linear, Shortcut, Notion, Azure DevOps) + 3 git hosts (GitHub PR, GitLab MR, Bitbucket PR)
  - Per-board environment variable fixtures derived from Zod schemas
  - `withCwd()` helper for running orchestrator in temp repo context
  - Separate Vitest config (`test:integration`) isolated from unit tests
- **QA gap analysis** (`docs/decisions/qa-strategy/AUDIT.md`) — board + hook test coverage matrix identifying comment posting and ticket creation as universal gaps

### ✅ Tests

- 1217 unit tests (unchanged) + 37 integration tests (4 new test files: MSW smoke, temp repo, Claude simulator, handler verification)

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-03-21

### ♻️ Refactors

- **AFK runner injection** — `runAfkLoop()` now accepts an optional `runner` parameter for dependency injection. Default behaviour unchanged (spawns `clancy-once.js` via `spawnSync`). Enables integration tests to call `run()` in-process where MSW can intercept board API calls.

### 📦 Internal

- **QA strategy decision docs** — 2-layer QA plan (integration tests + E2E) added to `docs/decisions/qa-strategy/`. 5 tickets covering infrastructure, implementer flows, board API/pipeline/hooks, E2E real platforms, and CI wiring.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-03-20

### ✨ Features

- **PR retry phase** — new phase 2a in the orchestrator retries PR creation for tickets that were pushed but failed to create a PR (network hiccup recovery). Scans progress.txt for `PUSHED` entries without a corresponding `PR_CREATED` and retries the API call.
- **Single-child parent auto-close** — when a single child ticket's PR targets `main` directly (single-child skip), the PR body now includes `Closes #{parent}` so the parent issue is also auto-closed on merge.
- **`--afk` flag on `/clancy:update`** — skips the confirmation prompt for autonomous setups. Respects `CLANCY_MODE=afk` as fallback.
- **AFK auto-pull** — all workflows with branch freshness checks (brief, approve-brief, plan) auto-pull in AFK mode instead of prompting. Planner's missing docs prompt also auto-continues.

### ♻️ Refactors

- **Copilot instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — rewritten to reflect current architecture (6 boards, 14 phases, Board type, 8+1 hooks).
- **PR template** — expanded checklists for new board support and doc updates.
- **Dead `.env.example` templates removed** — superseded by scaffold workflow.
- **Design doc trimmed** — `reliable-autonomous-mode.md` trimmed from 734 → 33 lines (decisions-only).

### ✅ Tests

- 1206 → 1217 (11 new tests — PR retry phase, single-child parent close, alreadyExists handling, GitHub key format)

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-20

### ✨ Features

- **Desktop notification hook** (`clancy-notification.js`) — native OS desktop notifications on Notification events. Supports macOS (osascript), Linux (notify-send), Windows (PowerShell). Falls back to console.log on unsupported platforms. Controllable via `CLANCY_DESKTOP_NOTIFY=false`.
- **Drift detector hook** (`clancy-drift-detector.js`) — PostToolUse hook (debounced, once per session) that compares `.clancy/version.json` against the installed package version. Warns when Clancy runtime files are outdated.
- **Quiet hours** — AFK runner pauses during `CLANCY_QUIET_START`–`CLANCY_QUIET_END` (24h format). Handles overnight windows (e.g. 22:00–06:00). Sleeps until the end of the quiet window, then resumes.
- **Version tracking** — installer writes `.clancy/version.json` on install/update for drift detection.
- **Board ecosystem** — setup workflows now support 6 boards: Jira, GitHub Issues, Linear, Shortcut, Notion, Azure DevOps. Init wizard includes auto-detection, credential collection, and `.env.example` templates for all new boards.
- **New env vars:** `CLANCY_QUIET_START`, `CLANCY_QUIET_END`, `CLANCY_DESKTOP_NOTIFY`, `SHORTCUT_API_TOKEN`, `SHORTCUT_WORKFLOW`, `NOTION_TOKEN`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`, `CLANCY_NOTION_STATUS`, `CLANCY_NOTION_ASSIGNEE`, `CLANCY_NOTION_LABELS`, `CLANCY_NOTION_PARENT`, `AZDO_ORG`, `AZDO_PROJECT`, `AZDO_PAT`.
- **Settings menu** — `[G10]` Quiet hours, `[G11]` Desktop notifications, board switch support for Shortcut/Notion/Azure DevOps.

### ♻️ Refactors

- **Hook count** — 6 → 8 hooks (+ notification, drift detector).
- **Board count** — 3 → 6 boards supported in setup workflows.
- **Init wizard** — board selection expanded to 7 options (6 boards + "not listed"), auto-detection hint for existing env vars.

### Migration from v0.7.x

Pipeline labels (`CLANCY_LABEL_BRIEF`, `CLANCY_LABEL_PLAN`, `CLANCY_LABEL_BUILD`) are new in v0.7.4 but your `.clancy/.env` won't have them after upgrading — `/clancy:update` copies new workflow files but does not modify your existing `.env`. Without these variables, the workflows use defaults (`clancy:brief`, `clancy:plan`, `clancy:build`), but Claude may skip the label step if it doesn't find the variable in the file.

**After upgrading, do one of:**
1. Run `/clancy:settings` → configure L1/L2/L3 pipeline labels
2. Or add manually to `.clancy/.env`:
   ```
   CLANCY_LABEL_BRIEF=clancy:brief
   CLANCY_LABEL_PLAN=clancy:plan
   CLANCY_LABEL_BUILD=clancy:build
   ```

Existing `CLANCY_LABEL` and `CLANCY_PLAN_LABEL` continue to work as fallbacks for the build and plan labels. There is no fallback for the brief label — it must be configured or the default is used.

### ✅ Tests

- 896 → 1206 (310 new tests across all waves — board modules, hooks, quiet hours, pipeline labels, installer modules)

---

## [0.7.4] — 2026-03-20

### ✨ Features

- **Pipeline labels** — 3 labels (`CLANCY_LABEL_BRIEF`, `CLANCY_LABEL_PLAN`, `CLANCY_LABEL_BUILD`) control ticket flow through stages: `clancy:brief` -> `clancy:plan` -> `clancy:build`. Each label acts as a queue marker. Only one pipeline label is present at a time.
- **Board label methods** — `ensureLabel` (create-if-missing), `addLabel` (add to issue), `removeLabel` (best-effort removal) on the `Board` type. GitHub: REST API, Jira: labels array, Linear: GraphQL mutations.
- **`--skip-plan` flag** — `/clancy:approve-brief --skip-plan` applies `CLANCY_LABEL_BUILD` directly instead of `CLANCY_LABEL_PLAN`, skipping the planning queue for clear tickets.
- **Label crash safety** — transitions use add-before-remove ordering so a ticket is never invisible to all queues.
- **Fallback resolution** — `CLANCY_LABEL_BUILD` falls back to `CLANCY_LABEL`, `CLANCY_LABEL_PLAN` falls back to `CLANCY_PLAN_LABEL`. Resolved in `fetch-ticket.ts` at queue pickup time. Existing users see no change.
- **Pipeline label prompts in init** — conditional on enabled roles (Strategist: all 3 labels, Planner only: plan + build, neither: skip).
- **Pipeline label settings** — `[L1]`, `[L2]`, `[L3]` settings for brief, plan, and build labels with deprecation notices for old vars.
- `CLANCY_LABEL_BRIEF`, `CLANCY_LABEL_PLAN`, `CLANCY_LABEL_BUILD` env vars added to all `.env.example` templates.

### ♻️ Refactors

- **Workflow label integration** — `/clancy:brief` adds `CLANCY_LABEL_BRIEF`, `/clancy:approve-brief` removes brief label and adds plan/build label to children, `/clancy:approve-plan` swaps plan for build label, `/clancy:once` filters by `CLANCY_LABEL_BUILD`.
- **Deprecated** — `CLANCY_LABEL` and `CLANCY_PLAN_LABEL` are deprecated in favour of the new pipeline label vars.

### ✅ Tests

- 853 → 896 (43 new tests for board label methods and fetch-ticket pipeline logic)

### Migration from v0.7.2+

Pipeline labels are opt-in. Existing `CLANCY_LABEL` and `CLANCY_PLAN_LABEL` continue to work as fallbacks — no breaking changes. To enable the full pipeline:

1. Run `/clancy:update` to pull the latest files
2. Run `/clancy:settings` → configure `[L1]` Brief label, `[L2]` Plan label, `[L3]` Build label
3. Or add manually to `.clancy/.env`:
   ```
   CLANCY_LABEL_BRIEF=clancy:brief
   CLANCY_LABEL_PLAN=clancy:plan
   CLANCY_LABEL_BUILD=clancy:build
   ```

---

## [0.7.3] — 2026-03-19

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Epic PR auto-closes GitHub issues** — epic PR body now includes `Closes #N` keywords for the parent and all child issues, so merging the epic PR to the default branch automatically closes them

---

## [0.7.2] — 2026-03-19

### ✨ Features

- **`--afk` flag for `/clancy:approve-brief`** — auto-confirm ticket creation without prompting, enabling fully autonomous brief-to-tickets flow
- **`--afk` flag for `/clancy:plan`** — skip batch confirmations, auto-skip done/closed/canceled tickets
- **`--afk` flag for `/clancy:approve-plan`** — auto-confirm plan promotion without prompting
- **Open question cross-referencing** — re-brief revision now explicitly matches feedback against Open Questions, moving resolved ones to Discovery with `(Source: human)` tag

### 🐛 Fixes

- **AFK mode guard for `/clancy:brief`** — running `/clancy:brief --afk` (or with `CLANCY_MODE=afk`) without a ticket or idea now exits with a helpful message instead of prompting an absent human
- **Brief comment detection** — marker search is now case-insensitive and heading-level-agnostic (`#` vs `##` vs plain text)
- **Next steps formatting** — improved readability with section headers and aligned commands

---

## [0.7.1] — 2026-03-19

### ♻️ Refactors

- **Phase pipeline** — decompose `once.ts` (650 lines) into 13 composable phase functions under `src/scripts/once/phases/`. Orchestrator is now 110 lines.
- **Board type abstraction** — unified `Board` type with `createBoard()` factory. Single switch statement replaces 6+ scattered switches in `board-ops.ts`.
- **Delete `board-ops.ts`** — 174 lines of switch dispatch + 319 lines of tests removed. All board operations now go through `ctx.board.*` method calls.
- **Env templates** — `.env.example` files updated with strategist (v0.6.0) and reliable autonomous mode (v0.7.0) env vars.

### ✅ Tests

- 764 → 853 (89 new tests from phase files + board wrappers, net of deleted board-ops tests)

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-19

### ✨ Features

- **Verification gates** — agent-based Stop hook runs lint/test/typecheck before delivery
- **Self-healing retry** — up to `CLANCY_FIX_RETRIES` attempts to fix failing checks (default 2, max 5)
- **PostCompact hook** — re-injects ticket context after context compaction
- **Branch guard hook** — blocks force push, protected branch push, destructive resets
- **Time guard** — warns at 80%/100% of `CLANCY_TIME_LIMIT` per ticket (default 30 min)
- **Crash recovery** — lock file prevents double-runs, resume detection recovers crashed sessions
- **Cost logging** — duration-based token estimation per ticket (`.clancy/costs.log`)
- **AFK session report** — summary of completed/failed tickets (`.clancy/session-report.md`)
- **Verification gate agent prompt** (`src/agents/verification-gate.md`)
- `CLANCY_FIX_RETRIES`, `CLANCY_VERIFY_COMMANDS`, `CLANCY_TOKEN_RATE`, `CLANCY_TIME_LIMIT`, `CLANCY_BRANCH_GUARD` env vars

### ♻️ Refactors

- `once.ts`: lock file lifecycle, `CLANCY_ONCE_ACTIVE` env var, cost logging after delivery
- `afk.ts`: session report generation after loop completion
- `context-monitor` hook: extended with time guard logic
- PR body: includes verification warning when checks failed
- Hook count: 4 → 6 hook files + 1 agent hook

### ✅ Tests

- 579 → 764 (185 new tests)

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-19

### ✨ Features

- **Strategist role** — `/clancy:brief` and `/clancy:approve-brief` commands
- Grill phase (human grill + AI-grill with devil's advocate agent)
- Brief template with Discovery section, vertical slices, HITL/AFK classification
- `Epic: {key}` description convention for cross-platform epic completion
- Blocker-aware ticket pickup — fetchTicket skips blocked candidates
- `fetchBlockerStatus` — Jira issueLinks, GitHub body parsing, Linear relations
- HITL/AFK queue filtering — AFK mode skips clancy:hitl tickets
- `fetchChildrenStatus` dual-mode — Epic: text search + native API fallback
- Stale brief detection hook (unapproved briefs > 7 days)
- `CLANCY_MODE`, `CLANCY_BRIEF_ISSUE_TYPE`, `CLANCY_BRIEF_EPIC`, `CLANCY_COMPONENT` env vars
- Devil's advocate agent prompt (`src/agents/devils-advocate.md`)

### ♻️ Refactors

- `fetchTicket` now fetches 5 candidates and returns first unblocked
- `fetchChildrenStatus` uses dual-mode (text convention + native fallback)
- Installer treats strategist as optional role (like planner)
- Setup init/settings/scaffold include strategist configuration

### ✅ Tests

- 507 → 579 (72 new tests)

---

## [0.5.13] — 2026-03-18

### ✨ Features

- **Glossary** (`docs/GLOSSARY.md`) — ubiquitous language for the project. Defines terms for roles, delivery model, orchestrator, strategist, planner, and infrastructure. Referenced by Claude and subagents via CLAUDE.md.
- **Key documentation table** in `CLAUDE.md` — links to architecture, visual diagrams, conventions, testing, git strategy, design docs, role descriptions, and guides. Ensures agents can discover all project documentation.

---

## [0.5.12] — 2026-03-18

### ✨ Features

- **Epic branch workflow** — parented tickets now create PRs targeting an epic branch (`epic/{key}` or `milestone/{slug}`) instead of squash-merging directly to main. When all children of an epic are done, Clancy automatically creates a final PR from the epic branch to the base branch. Every code change gets reviewed via PR before reaching the base branch.
- **Epic completion detection** — `fetchChildrenStatus` added to all 3 board modules (Jira JQL, GitHub Issues, Linear GraphQL). Returns `{ total, incomplete }` for automatic epic PR creation and single-child skip optimisation.
- **Single-child skip** — if an epic has only one child ticket, the epic branch is skipped and the child delivers directly to the base branch via PR (avoids unnecessary double-review).
- **Migration guard** — `ensureEpicBranch` detects local-only epic branches with unpushed squash-merged work from the previous delivery model and refuses to overwrite them, printing migration instructions.
- **`Part of` for GitHub Issues** — child PRs targeting epic branches use `Part of #N` instead of `Closes #N` to prevent premature auto-close before the epic reaches the base branch.
- **Rework parent preservation** — rework detection now reads the `parent:KEY` field from progress.txt entries, ensuring rework PRs target the correct epic branch instead of defaulting to main.

### ♻️ Refactors

- **`deliverViaEpicMerge` deleted** — all delivery goes through `deliverViaPullRequest` with the appropriate target branch. Simplifies delivery logic from two paths to one.
- **Progress parser rewritten** — `parseProgressFile` now uses named-prefix matching (`pr:`, `parent:`) instead of positional segment indexing, supporting the new `parent:KEY` suffix without breaking legacy entries.

### ✅ Tests

- 34 new tests (473 → 507), 10 existing tests rewritten for the new delivery model

### ⚠️ Migration

If you have in-flight epics with locally squash-merged children (from the previous Clancy version), push the epic branch manually before running `/clancy:once`:
```bash
git push -u origin epic/{your-epic-key}
```
Clancy will detect the local-only branch and print instructions.

---

## [0.5.11] — 2026-03-18

### 📝 Docs

- **AI-grill mode** — dual-mode grill phase for `/clancy:brief`. Human grill (interactive, multi-round) and AI-grill (autonomous, single-pass devil's advocate agent using codebase + board + web research). Mode determined by `--afk` flag or `CLANCY_MODE` env var.
- **`## Discovery` section** — new brief template section with source-tagged Q&A (human/codebase/board/web). Replaces the previous implicit auto-resolve approach.
- **`CLANCY_MODE`** — documented in scaffold templates, settings, init, and configuration guide. Values: `interactive` (default) or `afk`.

---

## [0.5.10] — 2026-03-18

### ✨ Features

- **TDD mode** (`CLANCY_TDD=true`) — when enabled, Clancy follows the red-green-refactor cycle for every behaviour change. Writes a failing test first, implements the minimum code to pass, then refactors. Applies to both new implementations (`/clancy:once`) and rework cycles. Configurable via `/clancy:init` and `/clancy:settings`.

### 📝 Docs

- **Strategist design docs updated for v0.6.0** — incorporates 5 improvements from Matt Pocock's agent skills analysis:
  - **Grill phase** — interactive clarification interview (5-20 questions) before brief generation. AFK mode auto-resolves using codebase context; unresolvable questions surfaced in `## Open Questions` section.
  - **Vertical slice decomposition** — validation rule enforcing end-to-end slices over horizontal layers, with right/wrong examples.
  - **HITL/AFK classification** — each decomposed ticket tagged as AFK (autonomous) or HITL (needs human). `clancy:afk`/`clancy:hitl` labels set on board tickets for `/clancy:run` filtering.
  - **Blocking-aware ticket ordering** — topological sort in `/clancy:approve-brief`; circular dependency detection.
  - **Strengthened user stories** — behaviour-driven format with traceability to decomposed tickets.

### ✅ Tests

- 7 new tests (466 → 473)

---

## [0.5.9] — 2026-03-16

### ♻️ Refactors

- **once/ modules reorganised into sub-folders** — each module now follows the project convention `<name>/<name>.ts` + `<name>/<name>.test.ts`, matching `shared/` and `board/` patterns.
- **`schemas/github.ts` renamed to `github-issues.ts`** — consistent with `gitlab-mr.ts` and `bitbucket-pr.ts`.
- **Unused `schemas/index.ts` barrel deleted** — nothing imported from it.
- **Test files included in tsconfig** — removed `**/*.test.ts` exclusion from `tsconfig.json` so VS Code resolves path aliases (`~/`) in test files. Build uses `tsconfig.build.json` to keep test files out of `dist/`. Fixed type errors in 7 test files.

### ✅ Tests

- **62 new per-module unit tests** (404 → 466) — co-located test files for board-ops (16), fetch-ticket (9), git-token (7), pr-creation (11), deliver (8), rework (11). The existing orchestrator integration tests in `once.test.ts` remain unchanged.

---

## [0.5.8] — 2026-03-16

### ♻️ Refactors

- **`once.ts` decomposed into 8 focused modules** — the 1292-line orchestrator has been split into small, human-readable modules. Each module handles a single concern: types (12 lines), board operations (122), ticket fetching (89), git token resolution (34), PR creation (107), delivery (200), rework detection + actions (379), and the orchestrator itself (398). Zero logic changes — pure extraction. All 404 tests pass unchanged.

---

## [0.5.7] — 2026-03-16

### ✨ Features

- **Post-rework PR comment** — after pushing rework fixes, Clancy leaves a comment on the PR summarising the addressed feedback (all platforms).
- **GitHub: re-request review** — after rework, Clancy re-requests review from reviewers who left feedback.
- **GitLab: resolve discussion threads** — after rework, Clancy resolves addressed DiffNote discussion threads.
- **GitHub: `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review state** — an additional rework trigger alongside comment-based detection. If any reviewer has requested changes via GitHub's review mechanism, rework is triggered.
- **Connectivity preflight** — `git ls-remote origin HEAD` runs during preflight as a warning-only check. If the remote is unreachable, a warning is printed but the run continues.
- **PR number in progress entries** — progress.txt entries now include a `pr:NNN` suffix when a PR is created, for future optimisation of rework detection.
- **previousContext in rework prompts** — rework prompts now include a `git diff --stat` against the target branch, giving Claude visibility into what files have already been changed.
- **Collapsible rework instructions in PR body** — rework instructions in the PR description are now wrapped in a `<details>` block to reduce visual noise.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Double progress logging on rework** — rework delivery was producing 2 progress entries (one from `deliverViaPullRequest` and one from `run`). Now produces exactly 1 (`REWORK`).
- **UTC timestamps in progress.txt** — `formatTimestamp()` was using local time methods (`getHours`, etc.). Now uses UTC methods (`getUTCHours`, etc.) for consistent cross-timezone behaviour.
- **Empty ticket description in rework prompts** — rework `FetchedTicket` had `description: ''`. Now uses the ticket summary as a fallback.
- **Rework detection expanded** — now scans `PUSHED` and `PUSH_FAILED` entries in addition to `PR_CREATED` and `REWORK`, catching PRs created manually after a push failure.
- **Author filtering prevents self-triggering rework** — Clancy's own PR comments are excluded from rework detection via `excludeAuthor` filtering (GitHub; other platforms use timestamp filtering).
- **Bitbucket Server "Only one pull request" detection** — `createServerPullRequest` now matches both "already exists" and "Only one pull request" messages on HTTP 409.
- **Bitbucket Server manual PR URL fallback** — `buildManualPrUrl` now returns a pre-filled URL for Bitbucket Server (was returning `undefined`).

### ✅ Tests

- 36 new tests (368 → 404)

---

## [0.5.6] — 2026-03-15

### ✨ Features

- **Auto-detect feedback for re-planning** — running `/clancy:plan` on an already-planned ticket auto-detects feedback comments and revises the plan. Replaces the old `--force` flag.
- **`--fresh` flag** — `/clancy:plan --fresh` discards any existing plan and starts from scratch, ignoring feedback.
- **Specific ticket targeting** — `/clancy:plan PROJ-123` plans a specific ticket by key instead of pulling from the queue. Supports `PROJ-123`, `#42`, and `ENG-42` formats.
- **Branch freshness check** — planner preflight now fetches from remote and warns if the local branch is behind, offering pull/continue/abort.
- **Skip comments** — when Clancy skips an irrelevant or infeasible ticket, a comment is posted on the board explaining why. Opt-out via `CLANCY_SKIP_COMMENTS=false`.
- **Post-approval transitions** — `/clancy:approve-plan` now automatically transitions tickets: GitHub label swap (plan label removed, implementation label added), Jira status transition via `CLANCY_STATUS_PLANNED`, Linear state move to unstarted. All best-effort.
- **Plan comment editing** — after approval, the plan comment is edited to prepend an approval note instead of being deleted.
- **Auto-select for approve-plan** — `/clancy:approve-plan` (no args) auto-selects the oldest unapproved ticket from `progress.txt` and shows a confirmation prompt.

### ♻️ Refactors

- **`/clancy:approve` renamed to `/clancy:approve-plan`** — prepares for v0.6.0 strategist role which adds `/clancy:approve-brief`.
- **Plan template reordered** — new canonical section order: Summary, Affected Files, Implementation Approach, Test Strategy, Acceptance Criteria, Dependencies, Figma Link, Risks/Considerations, Size Estimate.
- **Linear approve uses filter-based query** — replaced fuzzy `issueSearch` with `issues(filter: { identifier: { eq } })` for exact ticket matching.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Linear `.env.example` missing `CLANCY_PLAN_STATE_TYPE`** — added to the Linear scaffold template.
- **Init missing GitHub/Linear planning queue config** — init now asks GitHub users for `CLANCY_PLAN_LABEL` and Linear users for `CLANCY_PLAN_STATE_TYPE` when the Planner role is enabled.
- **`CLANCY_PLAN_STATE_TYPE` validated as enum** — now restricted to `backlog`, `unstarted`, `started`, `completed`, `canceled`, `triage` instead of accepting any string.
- **`PLANNER.md` template mismatch** — documentation now matches the actual workflow template sections and order.

---

## [0.5.5] — 2026-03-14

### ✨ Features

- **QA rework loop** — when a reviewer leaves feedback on a PR, Clancy picks it up automatically on the next run. Inline code comments (on specific diff lines) always trigger rework; conversation comments trigger with a `Rework:` prefix. Reads the feedback, builds a focused rework prompt ("fix the flagged issues, don't re-implement"), and pushes fixes to the existing branch — the PR updates automatically.
- **Comment-based rework detection** — Clancy scans open PRs for reviewer comments instead of relying on platform review states. Inline code comments always trigger rework. General conversation comments trigger when prefixed with `Rework:`. Works identically across GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Zero configuration needed — the PR body includes reviewer instructions automatically.
- **PR review comment fetching** — reads inline code review comments and conversation comments from GitHub, unresolved MR discussions from GitLab, and PR comments from Bitbucket (Cloud + Server). Comments are included in the rework prompt as actionable feedback.
- **Rework prompt** (`buildReworkPrompt`) — includes reviewer feedback and "address specific feedback" instructions.
- **Progress reader** — `findLastEntry()`, `countReworkCycles()`, and `findEntriesWithStatus()` for progress history scanning.
- **Max rework guard** — after N cycles (default 3, configurable via `CLANCY_MAX_REWORK`), ticket is skipped with "needs human intervention".

### 📝 Docs

- **Init workflow** — added Q3e (max rework cycles)
- **Settings workflow** — added max rework setting
- **Scaffold workflow** — added `CLANCY_MAX_REWORK` to `.env.example` templates
- **Implementer docs** — added automatic PR-based rework flow section
- **Configuration guide** — added `CLANCY_MAX_REWORK` to table
- **Troubleshooting guide** — added PR rework scenarios

### ✅ Tests

- 95 new tests (270 → 365): progress reader (15), rework prompt (7), git fetchRemoteBranch (2), GitHub PR review (12), GitLab MR review (12), Bitbucket PR review (18), rework-comment (10), orchestrator PR rework (8), env schema (2), Jira async (8), pr-body rework (1)

---

## [0.5.4] — 2026-03-14

### ✨ Features

- **PR-based flow when ticket has no epic/parent** — when a ticket has no parent (epic, milestone, or Linear parent), Clancy now pushes the feature branch and creates a pull request instead of squash-merging locally. Supports GitHub, GitLab (including self-hosted), and Bitbucket (Cloud and Server/DC). Falls back gracefully: push failure → leaves branch, PR failure → logs manual URL, no token → logs pushed status, no remote → leaves branch locally.
- **Remote detection** (`src/scripts/shared/remote/remote.ts`) — `parseRemote()` and `detectRemote()` parse git remote URLs and detect the git platform (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, GHE, self-hosted). `buildApiBaseUrl()` constructs the correct API base for each platform.
- **PR body builder** (`src/scripts/shared/pull-request/pr-body/pr-body.ts`) — `buildPrBody()` generates a PR description with a link back to the board ticket.
- **New env vars** — `CLANCY_STATUS_REVIEW` (transition status when creating a PR, falls back to `CLANCY_STATUS_DONE`), `GITHUB_TOKEN` (shared, for Jira/Linear users on GitHub), `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `BITBUCKET_USER`, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, `CLANCY_GIT_PLATFORM` (override auto-detection), `CLANCY_GIT_API_URL` (self-hosted API base).

### ♻️ Refactors

- **PR creation functions consolidated** — extracted GitHub PR creation from `board/github/github.ts` and moved GitLab/Bitbucket PR creation from `shared/remote/` into a new `shared/pull-request/` folder with co-located subfolders. All three git host PR creation functions now live together with a shared `postPullRequest()` utility that DRYs up the common POST + error-handling pattern.
- **`run()` function decomposed** — extracted `deliverViaEpicMerge()` and `deliverViaPullRequest()` from the 365-line `run()` function in `once.ts` for readability and testability.
- **DRY improvements** — extracted shared `formatDuration()` utility (was duplicated in once.ts and afk.ts), deduplicated `GITHUB_API` constant into `http.ts`, extracted `extractHostAndPath()` helper in `remote.ts` (was duplicated regex), removed local `LinearEnv` type in favour of schema-derived import.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Bitbucket duplicate PR detection** — both Cloud and Server PR creation now detect HTTP 409 "already exists" responses (was returning generic error instead of `alreadyExists: true`).
- **`CLANCY_GIT_PLATFORM` override always applies** — user override now takes precedence even when auto-detection returns a known platform (previously only applied when auto-detection returned `unknown`/`none`).
- **URL-encode branch names in manual PR URLs** — `buildManualPrUrl` now uses `encodeURIComponent()` to handle special characters in branch names.
- **Type-safe shared env access** — replaced unsafe `as Record<string, string | undefined>` casts with a typed `sharedEnv()` helper.

### 📝 Docs

- **Init workflow** — added Q2c (git host token for Jira/Linear) and Q3d-2 (review status)
- **Settings workflow** — added review status (B6/B4), git host token (H1) settings
- **Scaffold workflow** — added new env vars to all 3 `.env.example` templates
- **Implementer docs** — documented PR flow vs epic merge, updated loop diagram
- **Configuration guide** — added all new env vars to the table
- **Security guide** — added GitLab and Bitbucket token scope recommendations
- **Troubleshooting guide** — added push/PR failure scenarios
- **CLAUDE.md** — added PR-based flow technical decisions

### ✅ Tests

- 103 new tests (167 → 270): remote detection (35+4), shared `postPullRequest` utility (7), GitHub PR creation (5), GitLab MR creation (6), Bitbucket PR creation (7+2), git push (2), PR body builder (5), once orchestrator flows (3), `formatDuration` (5), `pingEndpoint` (5), Jira async functions (8), Linear async functions (6), `sendNotification` (3), `yellow` ANSI (1)

---

## [0.5.3] — 2026-03-14

### 🐛 Fixes

- **GitHub `@me` assignee bug** — Fine-grained PATs don't resolve `@me` in the Issues API. Clancy now resolves the authenticated username via `GET /user` and caches it for the session. Falls back to `@me` for classic PATs that support it.

### ✅ Tests

- Added 4 tests for `resolveUsername` (success, API failure fallback, network error fallback, cache verification)

---

## [0.5.2] — 2026-03-14

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Init missing queue config questions** — `/clancy:init` now asks for status transition names (In Progress / Done) on Jira and Linear, and planning queue status on Jira when the Planner role is enabled. Previously only the implementation queue status was asked for Jira, and Linear users had no way to configure transitions during init.

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-13

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Init "already set up" false positive** — `/clancy:init` now checks for `.clancy/.env` (created by init) instead of `.clancy/` (created by the installer). Previously, running `npx chief-clancy --local` then `/clancy:init` for the first time would incorrectly warn that Clancy was already set up.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-13

### ✨ Features

- **Planner role** — new `/clancy:plan` command fetches backlog tickets from the board, explores the codebase, and generates structured implementation plans posted as comments for human review. Supports batch mode (`/clancy:plan 3`), re-planning with feedback (`--force`), feasibility scanning, QA return detection, Figma design context, and parallel codebase exploration for larger tickets.
- **`/clancy:approve`** — promotes an approved Clancy plan from a ticket comment to the ticket description. Appends below the existing description with a separator — never overwrites.
- **Board comment write-back** — plans are posted as comments on all 3 boards: Jira (ADF format), GitHub (Markdown), Linear (GraphQL Markdown).
- **Planner settings** — new board-specific settings for the planning queue: `CLANCY_PLAN_STATUS` (Jira, default: `Backlog`), `CLANCY_PLAN_LABEL` (GitHub, default: `needs-refinement`), `CLANCY_PLAN_STATE_TYPE` (Linear, default: `backlog`). Configurable via `/clancy:settings`.

### 🎨 UX Improvements

- **Optional roles** — init now asks which optional roles to enable (Planner is the first). Stored as `CLANCY_ROLES` in `.clancy/.env`. Core roles (Implementer, Reviewer, Setup) are always installed. Roles can be toggled later via `/clancy:settings`.
- **Stable settings menu** — settings uses letter mnemonics (`G1`, `B2`, `P1`, `I1`, `S`, `X`) instead of dynamic numbers. Options no longer shift when boards change.
- **Natural language input** — init and settings workflows now instruct Claude to accept conversational responses ("jira" instead of "1", "yes please" instead of "y").
- **Progress indicators** — init welcome message now shows step count and estimated time.
- **Credential escape hatches** — board credential failures now offer `[2] Skip verification` alongside re-enter, instead of requiring Ctrl+C to exit.
- **Linear team auto-detection** — init auto-detects teams from the API after verifying the key, instead of requiring manual URL hunting.
- **Max iterations reordered** — moved to first optional enhancement (most universally relevant) with input validation.
- **Plan feedback instructions** — plan template footer now tells users how to request changes and re-plan.
- **Per-ticket progress** — `/clancy:plan` now shows progress per ticket during multi-ticket runs with Ctrl+C guidance.
- **Duplicate plan guard** — `/clancy:approve` checks for existing plans in the description before appending.
- **Transition guidance** — `/clancy:approve` now reminds users to move tickets to the implementation queue.
- **Linear exact match** — `/clancy:approve` verifies Linear `issueSearch` results match the provided key exactly.
- **Logs support new types** — `/clancy:logs` now parses and displays PLAN, APPROVE, and SKIPPED entries.
- **Update-docs personality** — added banner and Wiggum quote to `/clancy:update-docs`.
- **Review preflight inlined** — `/clancy:review` preflight is now self-contained instead of referencing status.md.
- **Update flow polish** — local patches info now shows before the completion banner; changelog format specified; network failure handled gracefully; restart instructions clarified.
- **Map-codebase interruptibility** — Ctrl+C note added to agent deployment message.
- **API error handling** — `/clancy:plan` now shows clear error messages when board API calls fail.
- **GitHub label clarity** — "no tickets" message explains the separate planning label for GitHub users.

### 📝 Docs

- **Updated help output** — `/clancy:help` and the installer banner now include the Planner section with `plan` and `approve` commands.
- **Updated .env.example templates** — all 3 board templates include planner queue configuration and optional roles.
- **Updated settings workflow** — planner queue settings added per board, roles toggle section added.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-12

### ♻️ Refactors

- **Architecture refactor — role-based source structure** — commands and workflows are now organized by role under `src/roles/{planner,implementer,reviewer,setup}/`. The installer walks each role's `commands/` and `workflows/` subdirectories and merges them into the same flat output directories (`.claude/commands/clancy/` and `.claude/clancy/workflows/`), preserving all existing `/clancy:*` command names. No functional changes — all commands work identically.

### 📝 Docs

- **Role-grouped help** — `/clancy:help` now displays commands grouped by role (Implementer, Reviewer, Setup & Maintenance) instead of a flat list.
- **Updated architecture docs** — `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect the new `src/roles/` structure.

---

## [0.3.9] — 2026-03-12

### ⚡️ Performance

- **Optimized runtime bundle size** — `clancy-once.js` reduced from 508 KB to 125 KB (75% smaller). Strips ~243 KB of unused zod locale translations via an esbuild plugin, and minifies both bundles. Moved from inline esbuild CLI to `esbuild.config.js` for maintainability.

---

## [0.3.8] — 2026-03-12

### ✨ Features

- **Prettier ignore handling** — During init, if a `.prettierignore` file exists, Clancy now appends `.clancy/` and `.claude/commands/clancy/` to prevent Prettier from reformatting generated files. On uninstall, those entries are cleanly removed. Projects without Prettier are unaffected.

---

## [0.3.7] — 2026-03-12

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Fixed feasibility check nesting error** — The `claude -p` call in the feasibility check created a blocked nested session when running inside Claude Code via `/clancy:once`. The workflow now evaluates feasibility directly (no subprocess) using the dry-run output, then runs the script with `--skip-feasibility`. The script-level `claude -p` check is preserved for standalone/AFK mode where it works correctly.

---

## [0.3.6] — 2026-03-12

### ✨ Features

- **Feasibility check before branch creation** — The once orchestrator now runs a lightweight Claude evaluation before creating branches or transitioning tickets. If a ticket requires external tools, manual testing, or non-code work, it is skipped cleanly with no dangling branches or stuck tickets. Fails open — if Claude is unavailable, the ticket proceeds normally.

---

## [0.3.5] — 2026-03-12

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Fixed Jira search schema validation** — The `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql` endpoint returns `isLast` instead of `total` in its response. The Zod schema required `total` as a mandatory number, causing validation to fail at runtime. Both fields are now optional.

---

## [0.3.4] — 2026-03-12

### ✨ Features

- **Non-interactive installer** — Added `--global` and `--local` CLI flags to `npx chief-clancy`. When present, the installer skips the interactive install-type prompt and auto-accepts the overwrite confirmation. The `/clancy:update` workflow now passes the detected install type, so updates run without user interaction.

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-03-12

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Republish with built bundles** — v0.3.2 was published without running the build step, so the bundled runtime scripts in `.clancy/` still contained the old JQL bug. This release is identical to 0.3.2 but with correctly built bundles.

---

## [0.3.2] — 2026-03-12

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Fixed Jira JQL query syntax** — `buildJql()` was joining `ORDER BY priority ASC` with `AND`, producing invalid JQL (`... AND ORDER BY priority ASC`) that Jira rejected with HTTP 400. The once command couldn't fetch tickets while review/status (which build JQL inline) worked fine.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-12

### 🔧 Breaking changes

- **Runtime scripts are now bundled** — `.clancy/clancy-once.js` and `.clancy/clancy-afk.js` are now self-contained esbuild bundles copied by the installer. They no longer `import('chief-clancy/scripts/once')` from `node_modules`. This means `npx chief-clancy` is fire-and-forget — zero runtime dependency on the npm package.
- **Subpath exports removed** — `chief-clancy/scripts/once` and `chief-clancy/scripts/afk` package exports are removed (no longer needed).
- **`zod` moved to devDependencies** — zod is now inlined into the bundles at build time, so it's no longer a runtime dependency.

### ⬆️ Upgrading from 0.3.0

```bash
npx -y chief-clancy@latest
```

The installer automatically replaces your `.clancy/clancy-once.js` and `.clancy/clancy-afk.js` with the new bundled versions. No manual steps needed. You can safely remove `chief-clancy` from your project's devDependencies if it was added for the shims:

```bash
npm uninstall chief-clancy
```

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-12

### 🔧 Breaking changes

- **Shell scripts replaced by TypeScript** — all four shell scripts (`clancy-once.sh`, `clancy-once-github.sh`, `clancy-once-linear.sh`, `clancy-afk.sh`) are replaced by TypeScript ESM modules. Board detection happens at runtime from `.clancy/.env`.
- **Prerequisites changed** — `jq` and `curl` are no longer required. Only `node` (22+) and `git` are needed.
- **Windows now natively supported** — WSL is no longer required since all shell scripts have been replaced by cross-platform TypeScript.
- **Shellcheck CI removed** — the shellcheck job is removed from CI since there are no more shell scripts.
- **Bash tests removed** — all `test/unit/*.test.sh` and `test/smoke/smoke.sh` files are replaced by Vitest tests co-located with their modules.

### ✨ Features

- **Unified once orchestrator** (`src/scripts/once/once.ts`) — single TypeScript entry point handles all three boards (Jira, GitHub Issues, Linear). Full lifecycle: preflight → board detection → fetch ticket → branch computation → dry-run gate → status transition → Claude session → squash merge → close/transition → progress log → notification.
- **Zod env validation** — all board credentials and shared config are validated at startup using `zod/mini` schemas with clear error messages for missing or malformed values.
- **Discriminated union board config** — `BoardConfig` type (`{ provider: 'jira' | 'github' | 'linear'; env: ... }`) enables exhaustive type checking across all board-specific code paths.
- **Board-agnostic runtime scripts** — `.clancy/clancy-once.js` and `.clancy/clancy-afk.js` are identical for all boards. No more board-specific script selection during init or settings changes.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Claude exit code check** — `invokeClaudeSession` now returns a `boolean` based on exit status. The orchestrator skips squash merge when Claude exits with an error, preventing empty or broken merges.
- **Linear label filtering relaxed** — removed overly restrictive `SAFE_ID_PATTERN` regex that rejected labels containing spaces or special characters. Labels are now trimmed and passed directly as GraphQL variables (inherently safe).
- **GitHub label parameter** — `fetchIssue` now accepts a configurable `label` parameter instead of hardcoding `'clancy'`, respecting the `CLANCY_LABEL` env var.
- **GitHub `per_page` bumped** — increased from 3 to 10 to reduce the chance of missing eligible issues when PRs (which the API returns alongside issues) consume result slots.
- **Force delete after squash merge** — `deleteBranch` now uses `git branch -D` instead of `-d`, since squash-merged branches are never seen as "merged" by git.

### 📝 Docs

- **All workflow markdown files updated** — references to shell scripts, `bash`, `chmod +x`, `jq`, and `curl` replaced with TypeScript/Node equivalents throughout all 9 workflow files.
- **scaffold.md reduced by ~1000 lines** — removed embedded shell scripts (3 board variants × once + afk), replaced with 2 short JS shim blocks.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md rewritten** — board contribution guide now describes creating TypeScript modules instead of shell scripts.
- **CONVENTIONS.md rewritten** — language matrix updated from Bash/Node to TypeScript ESM/Node CJS.
- **PR template updated** — checklist items reference TypeScript modules and co-located tests.
- **README** — updated permissions TIP (`curl` → `node`), stale references cleaned up.
- **CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, TESTING.md** — fully rewritten for TypeScript codebase.

### ⬆️ Upgrading from 0.2.x

```bash
npx chief-clancy@latest
```

**What changes:**
- `.clancy/clancy-once.sh` (board-specific) → `.clancy/clancy-once.js` (board-agnostic, bundled)
- `.clancy/clancy-afk.sh` → `.clancy/clancy-afk.js` (bundled)
- `jq` and `curl` are no longer required — only `node` (22+) and `git`

**What's preserved:**
- `.clancy/.env` — no credential changes needed, same env var format
- `.clancy/docs/` — all 10 codebase docs are untouched
- `CLAUDE.md` — the Clancy section is updated in place
- `.clancy/progress.txt` — your run history is preserved

**After upgrading:** you can safely delete any leftover `.sh` files in `.clancy/`:

```bash
rm -f .clancy/clancy-once.sh .clancy/clancy-once-github.sh .clancy/clancy-once-linear.sh .clancy/clancy-afk.sh
```

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-09

### ✨ Features

- **Shellcheck CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` lints all nine shell scripts on every push and PR to `main`, then runs the full unit test suite.
- **Auto update check** — `hooks/clancy-check-update.js` fires on session start, spawns a background process to check npm for a newer `chief-clancy` version, and writes the result to `~/.claude/cache/clancy-update-check.json`. The CLAUDE.md template reads this file and surfaces an upgrade notice at the top of every session.
- **Context window monitor** — `hooks/clancy-statusline.js` tracks context usage and writes a bridge file; `hooks/clancy-context-monitor.js` reads it after each tool call and injects warnings (WARNING ≤ 35%, CRITICAL ≤ 25%) with debouncing (5 tool calls between warnings, severity escalation bypasses debounce). The statusline also shows a colour-coded progress bar.
- **Targeted doc loading** — Claude now reads six core docs on every run (STACK, ARCHITECTURE, CONVENTIONS, GIT, DEFINITION-OF-DONE, CONCERNS) and loads the four supplementary docs (INTEGRATIONS, TESTING, DESIGN-SYSTEM, ACCESSIBILITY) only when relevant to the ticket.
- **Status transitions** — Jira and Linear issues now move through the board automatically. Set `CLANCY_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS` and `CLANCY_STATUS_DONE` in `.env` to the exact column name; Clancy transitions on pickup and on completion. Best-effort — never fails the run. Configurable via `/clancy:settings`.
- **`/clancy:dry-run` command** — dedicated slash command in the Claude Code dropdown. Previews which ticket would be picked up next (including epic, target branch, and feature branch) without making any git changes or calling Claude. Runs full preflight to catch config issues early. Works on all three boards.
- **Credential guard** — `hooks/clancy-credential-guard.js` is a PreToolUse hook that scans Write, Edit, and MultiEdit operations for credential patterns (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, connection strings) and blocks the operation if a match is found. Allowed paths (`.clancy/.env`, `.env.example`, etc.) are exempt. Best-effort — never blocks on error.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`/clancy:uninstall` left orphaned hooks** — the uninstall workflow only removed command and workflow directories. The three hook files, their `settings.json` registrations (SessionStart, PostToolUse, statusline), and the update check cache were all left behind. All are now cleaned up on uninstall.
- **Statusline never displayed** — the installer wrote `statusline` (lowercase, plain string) to `settings.json` but Claude Code requires `statusLine` (camelCase, `{type, command}` object). The statusline was silently ignored on every install. Fixed the key name and value format in the installer.
- **Hooks fail on ESM projects** — projects with `"type": "module"` in their `package.json` caused Node to treat hook files as ES modules, breaking `require()` with a `ReferenceError`. The installer now writes a `{"type":"commonjs"}` package.json into the hooks directory so the hooks always run as CommonJS regardless of the host project's module type.
- **Dry run created git branches before exiting** — the epic/milestone branch was created before the dry-run gate in all three board scripts, meaning `--dry-run` left behind a git branch despite printing "No changes made". Branch creation is now deferred to after the gate.
- **`DRY_RUN` overwritable by `.env` source** — the flag was set before `.clancy/.env` was sourced; a `.env` exporting `DRY_RUN=false` could silently negate `--dry-run`. Fixed with `readonly DRY_RUN` immediately after flag parsing in all three scripts.
- **Jira transition payload used string interpolation** — `IN_PROGRESS_ID` and `DONE_ID` were interpolated directly into the curl `-d` JSON string. Both are now routed through `jq --arg` for safe JSON construction.
- **Linear: silent failure when workflow state name not found** — if `CLANCY_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS` or `CLANCY_STATUS_DONE` didn't match any state in `workflowStates`, the transition was silently skipped with no feedback. An explicit warning is now printed so misconfigured state names are immediately visible.

### ✅ Tests

- **More test fixtures** — added edge-case coverage identified post-release: Linear `ISSUE_ID` extraction, Linear `CLANCY_LABEL` request body (with and without label), GitHub all-PRs response returning zero real issues.
- **Credential guard tests** — 32 tests covering non-file-writing tool passthrough, allowed-path exemptions, 13 credential pattern categories (AWS, GitHub, Stripe, Slack, private keys, connection strings, etc.), Edit/MultiEdit support, block reason content, and error resilience (malformed input never crashes). Total: 94 passing (up from 55).

### ⬆️ Upgrading from 0.1.x

Run `/clancy:update` or `npx chief-clancy@latest`. The installer handles everything — new commands, workflows, hooks, and `settings.json` registrations are added automatically. User-modified files are backed up to `.claude/clancy/local-patches/` before overwriting.

**Optional new `.env` vars** (documented in `.env.example`):
- `CLANCY_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS` — column name for auto-transitioning tickets on pickup (Jira/Linear)
- `CLANCY_STATUS_DONE` — column name for auto-transitioning tickets on completion (Jira/Linear)

No manual migration steps required. All new features work out of the box or are opt-in via `.env`.

---

## [0.1.7] — 2026-03-11

### 📝 Docs

- **README** — expanded "Updating Clancy?" section to describe changelog preview, confirmation prompt, and automatic patch backup; corrected "Uninstalling?" section to reflect CLAUDE.md and .gitignore cleanup; added global defaults mention under optional enhancements; updated test badge count from 34 to 51.
- **Roadmap** — moved patch preservation, global defaults, update preview, and uninstall cleanup from v0.2.0 to v0.1.x (already shipped); updated v0.2.0 to reflect current planned features.

---

## [0.1.6] — 2026-03-11

### ✨ Features

- **Patch preservation on update** — the installer now generates SHA-256 file manifests (`manifest.json`, `workflows-manifest.json`) during install. On subsequent installs (updates), it compares current files against the manifest to detect user modifications. Modified files are backed up to `.claude/clancy/local-patches/` with metadata before overwriting, so customisations are never silently lost.
- **Global defaults for settings** — `/clancy:settings` now offers a "Save as defaults" option that writes non-credential settings (max iterations, model, base branch, Playwright) to `~/.clancy/defaults.json`. New projects created with `/clancy:init` inherit these defaults automatically.

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-03-11

### ✨ Features

- **`/clancy:update` workflow rewrite** — now detects the installed version from the local `VERSION` file, compares against npm before running, shows the changelog diff and a clean-install warning, asks for user confirmation, and clears the update check cache after a successful update. Previously the update ran immediately with no preview or confirmation.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`/clancy:uninstall` left CLAUDE.md and .gitignore dirty** — uninstall did not clean up the `<!-- clancy:start -->` / `<!-- clancy:end -->` block it added to CLAUDE.md, nor remove the `.clancy/.env` entry it added to .gitignore. If Clancy created CLAUDE.md (no other content), it is now deleted entirely; if Clancy appended to an existing CLAUDE.md, only the Clancy section is removed. The .gitignore entry and comment are also cleaned up, and the file is deleted if Clancy was the only contributor.

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-03-10

### ✨ Features

- **Settings menu labels** — renamed `Status filter` to `Queue status` in the Jira settings menu to make it clear this controls which column Clancy pulls tickets *from*, distinct from the status transition settings.

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-09

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`scaffold.md` out of sync with source templates** — the shell scripts and `.env.example` files embedded in `scaffold.md` (written verbatim by Claude during `/clancy:init`) had diverged from their source templates in `src/templates/`. Synced all seven embedded blocks: four shell scripts (`clancy-once.sh` Jira/GitHub/Linear, `clancy-afk.sh`) and three `.env.example` files. Changes include expanded preflight error messages, additional inline comments, and fuller `.env.example` documentation.

### ✅ Tests

- **Drift test** — `test/unit/scaffold.test.sh` now extracts each embedded block from `scaffold.md` and diffs it against the source template. Covers all four shell scripts and all three `.env.example` files. Fails loudly if they diverge. Added to `npm test`.

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-09

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Shell scripts generated incorrectly on init** — the init workflow told Claude to "copy" `clancy-once.sh` from a source that doesn't exist after installation. Claude would improvise and generate a broken script (wrong API endpoint, BSD-incompatible `head -n -1`, etc.). The scaffold workflow now embeds the exact script content for all three boards so Claude writes it verbatim.

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-09

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Global install: workflow files not found** — commands installed to `~/.claude` reference workflow files via `@` paths that Claude Code resolves relative to the project root. For global installs, the workflow files weren't in the project so all commands failed to load. The installer now inlines workflow content directly into command files at global install time.
- **Jira: `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` format validation** — added a format check (`^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$`) before using the key in API URLs and JQL queries.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-07

- `/clancy:run` — loop runner with optional iteration count override; cost warning for 10+ iterations
- `/clancy:once` — pick up and implement exactly one ticket, then stop
- `/clancy:status` — read-only board check showing the next 3 tickets assigned to you
- `/clancy:review` — 7-criterion ticket scoring (0–100%) with actionable recommendations
- `/clancy:logs` — formatted progress log with ASCII epic progress bars
- `/clancy:map-codebase` — 5-agent parallel codebase scan writing 10 structured docs to `.clancy/docs/`
